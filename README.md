QUESTIONS:


1. How to complete two JSON have the same properties without order?

          a. var obj 1 = { name: "person 1", age:5 };
          b. var obj2 = { age:5, name: "person 1" };

2.Use the rest countries API URL -> https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all and disply all the country flags in the console
